    <p>
        Ryan Enterprises started simply as a law firm named "Ryan". <br>

        <h6 class="center">The old Ryan Law Firm logo</h6>
        Ryan would protect corperate interests from getting taxed too much. <br>
        It was not until Ryan Mullin, the current CEO and President of Ryan Enterprises, took the opportunity that he had, and bought the company. <br>
        He had a vision of a megaconglomorate. He wanted Ryan to own anyting and everything possible, and use the profits for the betterment of humanity <br>
        and the betterment of the world. In May 2020, Ryan introduced a new corperate identity, with a new logo. This logo was then revised into the one we know today. <br>

        <h6 class="center">Our new, and current logo</h6>
        Ryan's vision was to create a new, more modern, and more efficient brand for the world to see. This included a new name "Ryan Enterprises", and a brighter color scheme. <br>
        Today, Ryan Enterprises owns 90% of the world's best-known brands, and is the largest online retailer in the world. <br>
